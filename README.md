# docker-clamav for OpenShift

This repository is forked from the kuanfandevops/docker-clamav, which was also forked from the mko-x/docker-clamav.

The kuanfandevops/docker-clamav repository was not updated for 2 years. So, I updated it with the last changes from the original repository mko-x/docker-clamav.

The detailed information can be refered to [original repository](https://github.com/mko-x/docker-clamav)
The Docker file is modified to adapt to OpenShift environment.
